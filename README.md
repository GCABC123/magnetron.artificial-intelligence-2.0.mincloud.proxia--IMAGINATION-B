ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ : IMAGINATION PROXIA B

*️⃣📶🤖

REQUIREMENTS: 

[*] Software Requirements: Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook, Python, Tensor Flow

[*] HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: fast TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)

[*] DEPENDENCIES: INCLUDED


=============================================================

This is a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for (for one possible scheme in) developing an IMAGINATION proxia when working with ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ 
(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0™ is part of MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY). The machine running the Notebook will be a MINDCLOUD on which you will be
developing a PROXIA.

e.g On an ASTRAL MINDCLOUD this PROXIA can be used to process INFORMATION sent to it from an INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA/MINDCLOUD (OBJECT DETECTION). So for example if the ROBOT detects a cup with the OBJECT DETECTION on the INSTINCTIVE MIND MINDCLOUD it can IMAGINE a cup in some typical or unusual scenarios (On ASTRAL MINDCLOUD) to better understand what the detected object is and how humans see it.
